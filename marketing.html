									<h2>Revamping of our Brand<br />
									</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="images/BW.png" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/BW.png" /></a>
								<p>In May 2024, we decided to revamp our brand to give it a more chic and modern look. I came up with the logo to encapsulate our narrative.<br />
									1. BW: BW stands for our name, Bell & Win. It's our name, our essence, and what people come to recognize us by.<br />
									2. Map of Thailand: Placing a map of Thailand in our logo is a powerful symbolic choice. It communicates to our audience that our operations 
									are based in Thailand, fostering a sense of locality and trust. It tells our customers that we understand the local market intimately and are 
									positioned to cater to their needs effectively. <br />
									3. Shopping Bag: The shopping bag icon is a clear indication of our business's nature—personal shopping. It's instantly recognizable and universally 
									associated with retail and commerce. This element communicates the primary service or product we offer—assistance in shopping, whether it's for groceries, 
									fashion, or any other need. <br />
									4. Est 2022: Including "Est 2022" adds a touch of establishment and credibility to our brand. It communicates to our audience that we're not a newcomer but 
									rather have been around for some time, implying experience and reliability. It also serves as a subtle nod to our beginnings, highlighting the journey we've 
									taken since our establishment. <br />
